<h1>about</h1>
<p>this website is my personal collection of things i've managed to <em>clutter</em> and gotten attached to in the last decade that i keep in a shoebox in my closet. as migrants, we tend to hold on to objects and memories that transport us to every moment in life when we've felt like home. this stretches over an extra layer of nostalgia and connection to the objects in my box.</p>
