<h1>about</h1>
<p>this website is my personal collection of objects i've cluttered and grown attached to over the past two decadesâ€”treasures nestled in a shoebox hidden in my closet.</p>
<p>as a migrant, i find myself collecting fragments that transport me to moments when and where I've felt most at home. my understanding of <em>home</em> has expanded and shifted since leaving, stretching these objects with an extra layer of nostalgia and yearning.</p>
